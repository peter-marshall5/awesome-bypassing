# Bypassing guide for restrictions on Chromebooks
## (And other school computer systems)

### I just want to play games when I'm done with my work!
Skip straight to the Resources section at the bottom.

The first part of this guide is meant as more of an introduction to get started with developing your own bypass methods / exploits.

## Getting Started

If you want to get started with bypassing, you are going to want to have the following things:
- Some free time
- The knowledge that no system is 100% secure
- The motivation to experiment and fiddle with things
- Out-of-the-box thinking
- Some programming skills, preferably in Web development (Not strictly necessary, but will come in handy very often)
- A bit of familiarity with Linux (Kernels, the CLI, etc)
- A bit of familiarity with the workings and quirks of Chrome OS (The Chrome OS security model, Depthcharge, plus Bash and JavaScript)
- LOTS of patience
